## Components

1. **Command-line Interface**: Entry point for user interactions with the Lumino network.
2. **Blockchain Client**: Manages interactions with the Ethereum blockchain and Lumino smart contracts.
3. **Transaction Manager**: Handles the lifecycle of Ethereum transactions.
4. **RPC Client**: Manages low-level communication with the Ethereum node.
5. **Event Listener**: Subscribes to and processes blockchain events relevant to the Lumino network.
6. **Key Manager**: Handles cryptographic operations and key storage.
7. **Contracts ABI Manager**: Manages Ethereum contract ABIs for interaction with Lumino smart contracts.
8. **State Sync Manager**: Keeps the local state synchronized with the Lumino network state on the blockchain.
9. **ML Pipeline Executor**: Manages the execution of machine learning jobs within the Lumino network.
